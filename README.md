# GEO_242
Scripts and code developed in class for my GEO 242 computing class at UCR

## Course elements

The course covers various aspects of scientific computing that may be useful for geoscience graduate students. These include:

- The shell and shell scripting
- Simple data manipulation with awk and sed
- Plotting data and maps using GMT
- Making formatted text documents using LaTeX
- Solving simple inverse problems using MATLAB ([2022 edition](2022/)) and Python ([2025 edition](2025/))
- Nonlinear optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo

## Included codes, scripts and examples
### [2022](2022/)
- Linear inverse modeling (curve-fitting)
- Grid search (also curve-fitting)

### [2025](2025/)
- All of the lecture [slides](2025/slides/) used in the class
- The [files](2025/files/) used for in-class exercises
- My own [examples](2025/examples/) of shell scripts, GMT scripts, LaTeX documents and Jupyter notebooks with inverse models coded up

These are mostly preserved here for my own benefit, and provided without support. I did write in a lot of comments in the scripts and notebooks so that other people (and myself in future years) can follow what they are supposed to do. Hopefully that is enough!
