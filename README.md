# GEO_242
Scripts and code developed in class for my GEO 242 computing class at UCR

## Course elements

The course covers various aspects of scientific computing that may be useful for geoscience graduate students. These include:

- The shell and shell scripting
- Simple data manipulation with awk and sed
- Plotting data and maps using GMT
- Making formatted text documents using LaTeX
- Solving simple inverse problems using MATLAB ([2022 edition](2022/)) and Python ([2025 edition](2025/))
- Nonlinear optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo

## Included codes, scripts and examples
