# 2025 
In the 2025 instance of the class, I moved several of the in-class exercises to Python, making use of Jupyter notebooks. I also remade the slides in widescreen format, which was possibly only exciting to me!

What I have uploaded here:

## [slides](slides/)
The pdfs of the slides shown in the lecture parts of class, now in a much more screen-efficient widescreen format.

## [files](files/)
The data files, example files, Jupyter notebooks and other gubbins used in class, plus the homework assignments.

## [examples](examples/)
The files I ended up making myself during our class session, hopefully that can be used as exemplars for what I was hoping people would produce...
