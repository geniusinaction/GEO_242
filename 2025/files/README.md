# Files from the 2025 course
These were files used in our in-class exercises and homeworks, previously available through the Canvas site for the class.
- [GEO242.yml](./GEO242.yml) $-$ a requirements file for setting up a miniforge environment with most of the things you need to complete the exercises
- [files.tar](./files.tar) $-$ a slightly frivolous set of files named for animals, used to practice moving files around with the command line
- [eq_data.tar.gz](./eq_data.tar.gz) $-$ a set of files containing earthquake catalog information, used for an exercise in extracting data using awk
- [example_article.tex](./example_article.tex) $-$ an example article file for LaTeX
- [gji.bst](./gji.bst) $-$ an example bibliography style file for LaTeX and bibTeX
- [keeling.ipynb](./keeling.ipynb) $-$ a Jupyter notebook for a linear inverse modeling / curve-fitting exercise
- [san_andreas_1d_model_fit.ipynb](./san_andreas_1d_model_fit.ipynb) $-$ a notebook for a grid search / model-fitting exercise
- [optimization_and_mcmc.ipynb](./optimization_and_mcmc.ipynb) $-$ a notebook for fitting a model using optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches
- [assignment_1.tar](./assignment_1.tar) $-$ an assignment in using awk to reformat a set of files according to a set of specifications
- [assignment_2.tar.gz](./assignment_2.tar.gz) $-$ an assignment in plotting maps and data with GMT
- [git_instructions_20251204.pdf](./git_instructions_20251204.pdf) $-$ instructions for getting a functional setup with git and GitHub on the command line

Packages you will also need: a good X-windows text editor (I like gedit), TeXlive (or some other comprehensive TeX and LaTeX distribution), a good PostScript/PDF file viewer (I like evince) and git. Hopefully all are available through your favorite package installer!
